The EpubCreator is a tool that allows to create an epub from (currently) a docx file. It was designed specifically to make the task of creating an epub easier for the people at http://www.epublibre.org, an spanish web site where anybody can download high quality ebooks for free. This means that the output epub follows their standard or template epub (http://www.epublibre.org/libro/detalle/2653), and also that the conversion is very clean and free of unnecesary code in the html.

It works on Windows, Linux (requires Qt 4.8) and MacOs.
